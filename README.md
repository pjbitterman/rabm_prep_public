Public-facing prep scripts for publication

This repository houses the publicly-available prep scripts used in the manuscript <<title goes here>> (<<link goes here>>), as well as in Chapters 3 and 4 of my dissertation. Unfortunately much of the source data is unavailable at this time due to privacy concerns or forthcoming publications.

Please contact me via GitHub or patrick.bitterman@uvm.edu if you have any questions.
